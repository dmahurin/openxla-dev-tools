# OpenXLA Development Tools

This repository contains a Python package providing development tools
that span the OpenXLA suite of projects under the [openxla org](https://github.com/openxla).

It is primarily intended to be installed by developers. In everyday use,
it should not be necessary to actual modify the tools themselves.
